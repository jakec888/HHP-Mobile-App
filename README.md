## Peer-led Patient Advocacy

Peer-led Patient Advocacy is advocacy provided by trained volunteers who are matched to patients according to the needs of a patient and the skills of a volunteer. The service is provided free of charge, but where they are able to do so, patients are encouraged to make a small donation to help cover costs.

Advocacy is about supporting people who are not being heard about what they want. An advocate listens to a patient experiencing difficulty in order to understand their position, inform them about choices and options and then help them take action.

Patient advocacy is about empowering patients to use their right of autonomy in the healthcare system. It’s about informing patients about resources and inspiring confidence and ownership in their care plan.

Patient advocacy is not and does not involve giving patients advice or counseling, deciding on how to prioritize options, providing personal opinion, or withholding personal health information.

## Real-World Data Program

Healthcare is fragmented, and this adversely impacts quality, cost, and outcomes. For example, doctors and practitioners typically don’t have knowledge of each other’s medicines and the broad range of treatments available. Additionally, due to the rapid growth of technology and online resources, the amount of health information has increased exponentially. The abundance of information available has made it much more difficult to find the information you need. Knowing who to trust in a sea of commercial health resources can seem almost impossible.

These are significant problems, and that’s what HHP’s Real-World Data program is about. We provide independent, unbiased information from our community, including all types of medicines, to help you make informed healthcare decisions. Participate by sharing your experiences or learning about how others manage their health conditions.
